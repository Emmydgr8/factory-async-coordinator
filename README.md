# Factory Async Coordinator

An advanced smart contract framework for managing asynchronous task processing, scheduling, and coordination on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Factory Async Coordinator is a sophisticated Clarity smart contract system designed to provide robust, flexible, and secure asynchronous task management. By implementing a modular architecture, this framework enables complex task orchestration, queueing, and distributed processing.

## Core Components

The platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

### Async Task Factory (`async-task-factory`)
- Generates and manages task templates
- Supports dynamic task configuration
- Provides task type registration
- Implements flexible task metadata handling

### Coordinator Registry (`coordinator-registry`)
- Maintains a registry of task coordinators
- Handles coordinator authentication and permissions
- Manages global task coordination parameters
- Supports role-based access control

### Async Queue (`async-queue`)
- Implements a distributed task queue
- Supports priority-based task scheduling
- Manages task lifecycle states
- Provides reliable task enqueueing and dequeuing mechanisms

### Task Scheduler (`task-scheduler`)
- Coordinates task execution across the network
- Implements time-based and event-driven scheduling
- Supports recurring and one-time tasks
- Manages task dependencies and execution order

## Smart Contract Details

### Async Task Factory

The async task factory provides a flexible mechanism for creating and managing task templates with dynamic configuration capabilities.

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (create-task-template (task-type uint) (config (tuple))))
(define-public (update-task-template (template-id uint) (new-config (tuple))))
(define-read-only (get-task-template (template-id uint)))
```

### Coordinator Registry

Manages task coordinators, their permissions, and global coordination parameters for the async processing system.

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (register-coordinator (coordinator principal) (role uint)))
(define-public (update-coordinator-permissions (coordinator principal) (new-role uint)))
(define-read-only (get-coordinator-details (coordinator principal)))
```

### Async Queue

Implements a distributed task queue with advanced scheduling and lifecycle management capabilities.

#### Queue Management:
- Priority-based task enqueueing
- State tracking for tasks
- Atomic task state transitions

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (enqueue-task (task-template-id uint) (task-data (tuple))))
(define-public (dequeue-task))
(define-read-only (get-queue-status))
```

### Task Scheduler

Coordinates task execution across the network with support for complex scheduling scenarios.

#### Scheduling Features:
- Time-based task scheduling
- Event-driven task triggers
- Dependency management
- Recurring task support

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (schedule-task (task-id uint) (execution-time uint)))
(define-public (cancel-scheduled-task (task-id uint)))
(define-read-only (get-scheduled-tasks))
```

## Getting Started

To interact with the Factory Async Coordinator:

1. Register as a coordinator in the `coordinator-registry`
2. Create task templates using the `async-task-factory`
3. Enqueue tasks in the `async-queue`
4. Schedule and manage task execution via the `task-scheduler`

## Future Enhancements

The platform is designed to support future expansions including:
- Advanced task dependency resolution
- Cross-contract task coordination
- Enhanced performance monitoring
- Decentralized worker registration
- Dynamic resource allocation

This project is actively developed and welcomes community contributions.
